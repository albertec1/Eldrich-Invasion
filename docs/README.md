## Game Description

Candy Crush Saga is a free-to-play match-three puzzle video game, in the game, players complete levels by swapping colored pieces of candy on a game board to make a match of three or more of the same color, eliminating those candies from the board and replacing them with new ones, which could potentially create further matches. Matches of four or more candies create unique candies that act as power-ups with larger board-clearing abilities. Boards have various goals that must be completed within a fixed number of moves or limited amount of time, such as a certain score or collecting a specific number of a type of candy.

## History

Previous to the release of Candy Crush Saga, two more successful games were launched by King. The first one was Speed Miner, which was the first cross platform (Faceboock and mobile) game and then Bubble Witch Saga which introduced the “saga” approach to contrast the basic tile-matching games. Crush Saga was selected as King's next Facebook game based on the popularity of the portal version of Candy Crush. The basic cross-platform framework from Miner Speed was used to craft the foundation of Candy Crush Saga, adding the "saga" elements from Bubble Witch Saga. Initial ideas to expand Candy Crush into Candy Crush Saga were proposed by Knutsson, around 2011, including making the saga map visually look like a board game. The game was first released for Facebook in April 2012, at the time featuring only 65 levels. The game quickly gained popularity, gaining more than 4 million players within a few weeks of release.

## Game Features

The game is split among many levels, which must be completed in sequence. Each level poses a different challenge to the user, such as achieving a minimum score in a fixed number of moves or clearing candies in a fixed number of moves to bring special ingredients to the bottom of the board. Boards have a number of different configurations and may include special spaces that have their own unique rules, such as spaces covered with jelly that must be cleared by making a match on that space. If the player meets the level's goal, they will be given from one to three stars based on their score and can proceed onto the next level. Otherwise, they will lose one life and must try again. If the player runs out of lives, they have to wait for some period of real-world time while their lives regenerate before attempting the level again. Completed levels can be replayed if desired and the game is continuingly expanded, with the developers adding 15 new levels every week.

The game is primarily monetized through in-app purchases (through either a credit card, iTunes credits or Google Play credits); players begin with five "lives", lost whenever a level is failed. This applies to all of King's games. When they are exhausted, users can either send requests to their Facebook friends for more lives, wait for them to replenish themselves (a life is restored every half-hour), or purchase them. Initially when a player makes a purchase for new lives, they receive five new lives for a specific dollar amount. In a recent update, when a player makes a purchase for new lives, the player receives gold bars, the quantity depending on how much money they spend. Gold bars can be used for new lives, extra moves, boosters or to unlock a new episode. At certain points, primarily at the start of new "episodes", users must also either purchase or receive a request from at least three friends before they may access the next set of levels.

#### How do I complete levels?
There are currently 530 levels (not counting dreamworld) that you will have to beat to win the game (although it's fun to just take it level by level and not think of beating the game but beating the levels). To beat a level in Candy 
Crush you have to achieve two things. You must:
Get a score that will earn you at least 1 star
Complete the challenge that is explained to you at the start of the level. This can be many things from getting two striped candies to clearing a certain amount of jelly squares
When many people start playing they don’t realize that you can create better combos than just 3 of the same color candy. There are special candies in the game that create even better crushing power. There are striped candies, wrapped candies, color bombs, and more. Some ways you can make a special candy are:
Match 5 candies in a row to create a color bomb
Match 4 candies in a row as well as a column will make a striped candy
Match 5 candies in a row in the shape of a L or a T and create a wrapped candy
Crushing a striped candy clears the whole row or column
Crushing a wrapped candy clear a 3 x 3 area of candy
Switching a color bomb with any candy will clear the candy of that color. You can also mix color bombs with any other type of special candy and create a better effect
Combing a striped candy with a wrapped candy with create a larger candy that clears multiple rows and columns across the entire board
For more information on making special candies, check out our how to play candy crush guide.

#### What is Candy Crush Dreamworld?

It adds a new element to the game and is good if you are stuck on a level and want to change the game up a little bit. You can also view more information on Candy Crush Dreamworld.

#### How many lives do you get?
In Candy Crush Saga you will begin with 5 lives. When you fail to complete a level a life will be taken from you. If you wait 30 minutes, your life will be renewed. You can also receive lives from your friends. Alternatively, you can try our Candy Crush Unlimited Lives trick if you are playing on a mobile device.

#### Why does my friend send lives but I only have 5?
This is because you can only have a maximum of 5 lives. When you receive lives from your friends, you should not select all and accept. You will simply lose the lives you were given if you already have 5. Instead, once you get to 0 lives.. open your inbox and accept no more than 5 lives (if you have that many) and then close it. This way you will get the lives instead of wasting them. This is just a little trick that Candy Crush Saga doesn’t tell you about. Never use the accept all!

#### What are all the types of challenges?
In order to beat the levels you must pass a challenge that is given to you by the game. There are currently 5 different types of challenges that you will face in Candy Crush Saga.
##### Score:
This type of challenge is simply scoring a certain amount of points in the amount moves you get or less.
##### Jelly Levels:
Jelly levels are levels where the game makes you clear a certain amount of jelly on the board to beat the level. To remove jelly you must match the candy over it or use a special candy to crush it. If all the jelly isn’t cleared by the amount of moves you get, you will fail the level.
##### Ingredient Levels:
Ingredient Levels are some of the tougher levels. In this challenge there will be either cherries, hazelnuts, or both on the board. You must bring down the ingredients to a certain part of the board. You will know where to bring the ingredients down to because there are little green arrows that show you where the ingredients can go.
##### Timed Levels:
Time levels are levels in Candy Crush Saga where you must score a certain amount of points in a certain amount of time. If you do not score the challenged points, you will fail the level.
##### Order Levels:
Order levels may not be what it seems to you. In this challenge, you are tasked with collecting a number or type of candies. You can be requested to collect (for example) 50 yellow candies, 20 red candies and 6 blue candies. You could also be requested to collect 5 striped candies and a color bomb. If you do not collect the requested order before your moves run out, you fail the level.

#### What are boosters?
Extra MovesBoosters are special items you can win or get that help you better beat the level. They are great for when you are stuck on a level and need a little help. Some examples are the lollipop hammer when smashes a candy of your choice and the 5 extra moves booster that gives you 5 extra moves. For all the boosters and what they do, check out our Candy Crush Boosters page.

#### What are blockers?
Licorice SwirlIn Candy Crush, blockers are items that will block you on each level. There are many types of blockers like chocolate, meringues and locked licorice. Blockers will try and stop you from beating a level. For all the blockers in Candy Crush, check out our Candy Crush Blockers page.

#### Why can’t I see the Daily Booster Wheel?
Many people have trouble finding or viewing the daily booster wheel. Most likely this is because you need to update your Candy Crush app (if you are playing on a mobile device). Once you update the app, you will see the new features like the daily booster wheel. If you are all updated and you simply cannot find it, check out our daily booster wheel page for more information on where to find it and how to use it.
